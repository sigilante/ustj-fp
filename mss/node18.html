Support a single hardware platform</A>
</H3>

<P>
A permanent commitment to a single hardware platform—either for the Urbit platform as a whole or for a particular running instance—could solve the determinism problem.  This configuration would be tenable for single-purpose ships with lifetime control (likely moons or comets), but inconvenient for the “hundred-year computer” model touted for planets and superior ranks in Urbit.

<P>
To make a lifelong commitment to a particular hardware platform when the lifetime of a deterministic computer is unknown is therefore deemed foolhardy.
