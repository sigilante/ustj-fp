Floating-point operations are a technically complex subject and the extent to which developers or source code alter or test this information will depend on many factors. Apart from the general exhortation to developers to be careful and to make sure they know what they are doing, there is little of practical use that can be recommended.  [p.&nbsp;197]Jones2008

Modern digital computers deal, at their root, in binary representation, entirely zeros and ones.<A ID="tex2html1"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot23"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN></SUP></A>  These are often formally considered to be whole numbers in a number base of two.  However, numerical calculations very frequently require the use of numbers with a fractional part to adequately represent the elements of a computation.

<P>
Early numeric computing tended to focus on problems of interest to military and national security applications, such as partial differential equations and numerical optimization.  Such calculations typically involve arrays, and linear algebra was elaborated hand-in-hand with digital computing techniques in software and hardware.  Numerics assumed prominence for a wider audience with the rise of gaming on personal computers, although these algorithms emphasized speed over exactness.<A ID="tex2html2"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot24"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN></SUP></A>  To this point in the history of computing, most software either ran on a single platform for its lifetime (as with supercomputing) or did not require portably deterministic algorithms (as with gaming).<A ID="tex2html3"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot25"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN></SUP></A>
<P>
On the other hand, deterministic computing describes the ability for a given computation be reproducible exactly.  Such reproducibility permits referential transparency and more powerful reasoning about a program's results and dependencies.  This includes, for Urbit as a state machine, that the event log replay be portable across platforms to yield the same result.  Conceptual guarantees must be backstopped by actual implementation guarantees for determinism to hold.
