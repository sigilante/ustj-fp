Machine epsilon.</A>
</H4>

<P>
The machine epsilon, or smallest value discernable from 1.0, is determined by the precision of the floating-point representation.  The machine epsilon for a particular bit width is determined by setting two to the negative power of the number of bits used for the magnitude of the mantissa and accounting for the leading implicit bit <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">1</SPAN>; for 32-bit single-precision <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">float</SPAN> this is <tex2html_verbatim_mark>#math42#<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><tex2html_image_mark>#tex2html_wrap_inline390#</SPAN>.  Differences from 1.0 smaller than this cannot be represented in this bit width.

<P>
