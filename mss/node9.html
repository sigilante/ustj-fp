<P>
Whether something is a gap or optional is something of a philosophical question for us, but some parts are underspecified in a way that makes portability impossible.  E.g., mixed-precision operations can yield unpredictable results depending on the compiler and hardware.  This is a function of rounding modes, precision loss, precision of intermediate results, and the presence or absence of dedicated hardware support for certain precision combinations.
